                    <h1>The Milky Way</h1>
                    <p> The Milky Way is the spiral galaxy that humanity calls home, stretching more than 
100,000 light-years across and containing hundreds of billions of stars, countless planets, vast 
clouds of gas and dust, and mysterious dark matter. From Earth, it appears as a hazy, luminous 
band that arcs across the night sky—an ancient sight that has inspired myths and stories 
across cultures. To the naked eye, this band is the combined light of millions of distant stars 
packed so closely that they blur together. At its core lies a dense region of stars and a 
supermassive black hole known as Sagittarius A*, with a mass equivalent to about four million 
suns, exerting a powerful gravitational pull that shapes the galaxy. From this hub, the spiral 
arms extend outward, filled with stellar nurseries where stars are born and remnants of those 
that have died; our Solar System sits in one of these arms, the Orion Arm, about 27,000 light-
years from the center. The Milky Way is part of the Local Group of galaxies, alongside 
Andromeda and the Magellanic Clouds, and in about 4 billion years it will collide with 
Andromeda, reshaping both galaxies. Throughout history, cultures have seen it as spilled milk 
from the goddess Hera, a celestial river, or a road of souls, and it has guided explorers and 
storytellers alike. Today, it remains a source of wonder and scientific exploration, with 
telescopes mapping its structure and space probes venturing beyond the Solar System, 
reminding us that every star in the night sky is part of the vast galactic neighborhood we call 
home.  </p>
